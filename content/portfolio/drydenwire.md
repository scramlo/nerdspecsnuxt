**Overview**

With over 144,000 page views per month, DrydenWire has established itself as a trusted news source in Wisconsin. The owner was doing amazing things with journalism, but struggling with a drag and drop solution to display content. The web designer Mr. Dryden was working with approached me to see if I had an ideas on how to help. I wrote the entire application from scratch. Now, the content managament system works for them. Whereas the website used to load over 5+ megabyetes, it now runs under 2 megabytes, with images lazy-loading and relying on CDNs and heavy cacheing functionality. 

Image optimization and manipulation was another custom feature. Daily releases of mugshots are part of this platforms content strategy. However, mugshots are not optimized for widescreen banners. No worry, custom PHP scripts create backgrounds on the first view and cache these resources thereafter. 

Fast-forward a couple of years and this news site has over 6,500 articles and is now being franchised to other counties.
