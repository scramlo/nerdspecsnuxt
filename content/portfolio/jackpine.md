**Overview**

I was asked to create a website that could process images in excess of 30MB. 

I was asked to follow the "feel" of the paintings and create a retro-country theme.

I was asked to create a user interface that was uncomplicated.

It was fun and interesting to research the time period and artistry of this artist's genre. He gave me a great deal of content to sift through. Eventually, I settled on an appropriate color scheme and incorporated repeatable textures that look great, but don't slow the site down.

The logo was to go along with the retro theme, but I also wanted to keep it clean and modern.

What is exciting about this project is that Bob eventually started selling lots of art! He is now featured at Menards, Amazon, and Wayfair! 

We recently implemented an online store.
