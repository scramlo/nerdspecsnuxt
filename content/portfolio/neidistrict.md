title: "NEI District"

**Overview**

The Northeastern District of the Nazarene connected with me to help them with their Wordpress site. Unfortunately, the server they were using was a cheap, slow, shared server. Further, Wordpress wasn't cut out for the complexity of this organization's goals. I worked closely with the adminstration and leadership of the NEI District to come up with a web application that worked for them. It is truly a customized piece of software with several users logging in from different departments, all able to simulateously create a beautiful and fool-proof web portal used by hundreds weekly.
