**Overview**

Common Ground Prayer House originally began working with me to revamp their website and do some logo work. However, it became apparent that there was a problem with getting local area churches all praying together for city-wide vigils. The only real solution was a user-system. The leadership of CG explained how they foresaw a "calendar-like" application which could take in users. Eventually, the app would grow to allow for leadership to add and remove people as needed. It's a fun, intuitive application. 

One of my favorite techincal aspects of the CG Prayer App is that as users browse blank days, they aren't actually browsing data from the database. Instead, a JavaScript frontend creates a view which does not exist persistently. However, once the user adds a slot, the day is created in the database, as well as the slot, etc.
