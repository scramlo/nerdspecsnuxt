**Overview**

ArborXR was a very exciting  company to work for. They have [raised a ton of money](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/13/arborxr-secures-12m-to-boost-management-platform-for-ar-and-vr-devices/) to become the de facto mass XR headset management solution for large and small fleets.

**Highlights** 

- One of my favorite features was working with the backend and device teams to create a remote deployment action. Users were now able to launch applications to an unlimited number of devices remotely.
- I really enjoyed working with the UI designer on the Product Team. Much of my feedback was iterated on and utilized in our end features.
- I worked with our Team Lead to make scalable architectural decisions, such as how we provide and inject constant values throughout the application.
- The team at ArborXR worked with Vue 3 in alpha and helped contribute to the framework. I learned a great deal about how Vue works under the hood.
