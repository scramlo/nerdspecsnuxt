**Overview**

Working at GradeCam was a wonderful experience. We created software that helped thousands of educators across the United States save time and gain powerful analytics on student success.

**Highlights** 

- Integrating AI into our product to allow for auto importing of teacher answer keys into our system. This saved hours of work for instructors and gave us a taste of the power of AI to provide value to users. In addition to this integration, we created our own in-house testing framework to fine tune our prompt and compare and contrast LLM models. 
- Greenfielding a new business-focused product and getting to market in less than six months.
- Setting up Cypress framework, including database seeding, teardown, and authentication. I love Cypress and enjoyed mentoring other team members in E2E testing. I believe that if tests are more enjoyable to write, engineers will write more of them! This has a direct link to the bottom line.
