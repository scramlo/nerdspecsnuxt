**Overview**

Nerd Specs Creative is my freelance agency. Starting in 2014, I have created custom web applications for clients. Additionally, I  provide creative direction, marketing, web hosting, email hosting, and support. Aside from software, I have created graphics, motion graphics, 3D renderings, and taken photos for companies.

**Highlights** 

- Using a variety of tech stacks, tools, and frameworks. It is enjoyable to help a client whiteboard through their outcomes and create a software solution that fits them.
- Creating DrydenWire, a local news site that brings 70,000 true visitors a month. I leveraged automatic image cropping, optimization, and caching to achieve a snappy experience for this media-rich application. I also made the publishing experience easy to use.
- Helping non-profits like Spooner Wesleyan Church, New Journey Community Church, Wabash Help, and Wabash Prayer House help more people through better software solutions.
