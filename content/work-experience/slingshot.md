title: "Full-Stack Engineer"

**Overview**

Slingshot is the #2 textbook fulfillment service behind Amazon. We integrated with the enrollment systems of universities and automatically provided course material for students. In 2020, Slingshot created a completely new product called Campus Edu that allowed course creation, sharing, and degree audit integration. I worked 50% of my time on white label student portals for Slingshot, 25% on our Campus Edu LMS, and 25% on our course discovery and discovery tools.

**Highlights** 

- One of my favorite experiences at Campus Edu was the opportunity to greenfield the "Bridge" product. This is a SPA written in Vue 3, Vuetify, and JHipster that bridges data between our Moodle LMS and university registrar offices. I enjoyed making architectural and UI decisions. 
- I wrote custom logic for lazy loading images, giving multiple source sets, and integrating with a CDN for our client-facting course discovery tool. Even though the images were large and beautiful, the experience was snappy for end users.
- We were allowed to give presentations at Campus and Slingshot, and I was always eager to take the time to do so. I believe knowledge sharing and mentoring is some of the best time we can spend as engineers.
